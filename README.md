## Downloads
I will be posting new versions semi-regularly on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com). Once the mod is playable, you can find the latest stable version along with previous stable versions there. Then you just need to add the jar file to your mods folder and you're good to go. If this is your first time installing a mod, you will most likely want to follow the instructions found [here.](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mods/Installing_Forge_mods)

## Finished Features
- None

## Planned Features
- Procedurally generated dungeons
- Separate dimensions for generated dungeons
